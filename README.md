# Tethered_cell
ImageJ Fiji script for tethered cell assay.  
I used this script in "Novel Insights into Conformational Rearrangements of the Bacterial Flagellar Switch Complex", DOI: 10.1128/mBio.00079-19

# How To Use

* Install ImageJ Fiji from https://imagej.net/Fiji/Downloads
* Put tethered_cell.py script into 'Fiji.app\plugins\' directory.
* Click 'Plugins' -> 'tethered_cell'.
* Select tethered cell tiff file (or available stack file supported by ImageJ). I prepared 'test_movies/1103_pH6.5_2016.04.15_17.17.19S.ihvideo-2.tif' for test.
